📄 Project Overview

The Pothole Detection & Filler Vehicle is an Arduino-based automation system designed to detect road potholes using ultrasonic sensors and automatically fill them using a motor-driven mechanism. The project demonstrates how embedded systems and IoT technologies can contribute to smart road maintenance by reducing manual effort and improving safety.

🎯 Objectives

Detect potholes in real-time using depth-sensing technology.

Automatically activate a filler mechanism when a pothole is detected.

Minimize human intervention in road repair processes.

Provide a cost-effective prototype for smart infrastructure applications.

⚙️ System Components
Component	Function
Arduino UNO	Microcontroller used for processing sensor data and controlling actuators
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)	Measures the distance between the vehicle and road surface to detect potholes
12V DC Motor	Operates the filler mechanism to dispense filling material
Motor Driver (L298N or equivalent)	Controls motor speed and direction based on Arduino commands
Power Supply (12V)	Provides power to the motor and circuit
Chassis / Prototype Vehicle	Serves as the base structure for mounting sensors and motor system
🧠 Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance from the vehicle to the road surface.

The Arduino UNO compares the measured value with a predefined threshold.

When the distance suddenly increases beyond the threshold (indicating a pothole), a signal is triggered.

The 12V DC motor activates to operate the filler mechanism, releasing material into the pothole.

Once the surface returns to normal level, the motor stops automatically.

This ensures real-time detection and filling without human input.
